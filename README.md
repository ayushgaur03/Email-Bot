# EMAIL BOT ![](https://img.shields.io/github/license/ayushgaur03/Email-Bot?style=plastic)

This is a _Python Bot_ created to send emails by means of interacting with your bot. The `EmailBot` is capable of listening to your voice and use the input provided as text. You just need to tell the recepient's email address and speak out the message.

## Requirements:

- To create the EmailBot, you will need to use _Python Libraries_ mentioned in the **requirements.txt** file.
- A `color.py` file contains a `color class` which is used to color the text part that the EmailBot will generate in your terminal.
- In order to make Email Bot work for your email you need to know SMTP address of your email address' domain

## Features:

- Its a hands-free bot, i.e., once you run it you don't need to type anything, just need to interact with the bot and the rest of the work will be done by the `EmailBot`.
- You can store _email contacts_ to the bot. Thus, the email addresses of individuals can be accessed using their aliases in the program.
- The command line interaction is color encoded, thereby enhancing the UI experience of the user.

**Note:** I am still working on the EmailBot. I am working on different features to add on to it. If anyone wants to contribute just ping me up with an idea.
